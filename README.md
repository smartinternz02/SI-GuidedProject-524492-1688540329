# Chronic Kidney Disease
  The kidneys play a crucial role in filtering waste products and excess fluid from the blood, regulating electrolyte balance, and producing hormones that control blood pressure and stimulate red blood cell production.

# Project Description
  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition characterized by the gradual loss of kidney function over time. It is a serious health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. can be cured if treated it in the early stages. Usually, people are not aware that medical tests, we take for different purposes could contain valuable information concerning kidney diseases. Consequently, attributes of various medical tests are investigated to distinguish which attributes may contain helpful information about the disease.The information says that it helps us to measure the severity of the problem, the predicted survival of the patient after the illness, the pattern of the disease and work for curing the disease.

# Solution
  Our objective is to forecast individuals diagnosed with chronic kidney failure (CKD) and individuals without the disease (notCKD). Consequently, we are constructing a Machine Learning model utilizing IBM Watson Machine Learning Service to estimate the compressive strength of concrete.The model's predictions are subsequently displayed on a user interface.
